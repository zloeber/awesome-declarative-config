An awesome list of declaratively configured applications and engines.

## Introduction

This is a list of awesome application which qualify as being declaratively configured. To understand what qualifies for this list, it is important to understand what declarative actually means. Declarative programming [as defined in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) is; 

> "a style of building the structure and elements of computer programsâ€”that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow."

An operator can declare what they want and the app makes it a reality by handling all the gritty details. Truly declarative languages that must figure out several interdependencies in the correct order in a repeatable manner will often employ graph theory such as [direct acycle graphs(DAGS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) to achieve their desired results. For example, a common declarative infrastructure tool known as terraform will use such algorithms along with a separate 'state' to speed up future runs and track the current known state after the declarative manifest has processed. In theory, this allows not only to deploy repeatable infrastructure for IT projects, but also can be used to control configuration drift by making the deployment itself idempotent.

At a high level, a declaratively structured workflow looks pretty simple.

```mermaid

    Manifest[Declarative Manifest (DSL)]
    Engine[[Declarative Engine]]
    State[Desired State]
    Manifest-->|Processed via|Engine
    Engine-->|Produces|State
```

The declarative engine is an abstraction layer that produces a desired end state from an input manifest written in a Domain Specific Language (DSL). This is a simple but powerful approach to application configuration and deployment workflows.

# Understanding Declarative Configuration

The next few sections will provide a foundation of knowledge about declarative processing that should help to solidify ones understanding of the topic.

## Benefits

Several benefits emerge when using declarative engines to accomplish tasks. Here are a few of them in no particular order.

1. Declarative manifests are typically far easier to read and comprehend
2. Succinctness of configuration
3. Reusability of configuration
4. Idempotent configuration is typically baked in
5. Configuration drift can be more easily prevented
6. Configuration as code becomes far easier to accomplish (and by natural extension, GitOps becomes attainable)
7. Codebase is naturally self-documenting in most cases

## Drawbacks

There are drawbacks to this model as well. A few of these in no particular order.

1. State management can be trickier to maneuver in some cases 
2. Upgrade of the underlying DSL schema can be a labyrinthine effort
3. Version 'pinning' of configuration code becomes far more important
4. Exclusivity of declarative configuration is almost required to reap the aforementioned benefits

These drawbacks typically emerge in more complex declarative configurations.

## Personal Opinion 

It is the author's belief that the evolution of information technology is driven forward by widespread adoption. In order to adopt technology it must first be consumable. In order to be consumable it must be approachable and easier to use. As we have evolved our ability to create human consumable GUIs for the masses there has also been an evolution in backend orchestration required to operate the ever growing piles of technology required to serve them. The declarative configuration of all things has become much plausible with the advent of container orchestration (Kubernetes) in our industry.

## Declarative Categories

Three broad categories of software will be considered for this list. The difference between them is a bit fuzzy but largely comes down to the target of the declarative manifests it consumes. Categories are as follows:

1. **Engine** - Engines consume declarative manifests in some manner to simplify the attainment of desired state of a broad range of systems outside of the application itself. A prime example of a declarative engine would be Terraform.

2. **Application** - An application which is able to be configured declaratively or uses declarative manifests to accomplish application specific tasks. One example of a declarative application would be a Kubernetes operator.

3. **Platform** - A platform which consumes declarative manifests to configure or deploy platform specific elements. A great example of a declarative platform would be Kubernetes.

## Qualifying For This List

The crux of a declarative configuration file is the manifest used to actually declare things. The input for a declarative application, platform, or engine will be one or more declarative manifests that meed the following criteria;

* Are human readable
* Follow a concrete configuration schema or language definition
* Ideally produces idempotent results when processed 
* Present a reduction of overall complexity to the operator

We do not include dependency graphing or other more complex mechanisms as a requirement as it is perfectly plausible to meet the above criteria without advanced pathing/convergence techniques. The manifest format is not relevant either. They need only be human readable so that one can look at a manifest and understand what the end state will be if processed. This means toml, hcl, json, ini, cuelang, and (the ever loved/hated) yaml are perfectly valid declarative configuration formats on [this list](LIST.md).

## What Does Not Qualify

Some applications that have broad industry support can be used as a means to enable declarative declaration for any number of other applications. For example, a great deal of effort has gone into modernizing applications to run on Kubernetes via helm. These helm packages come in the form of versioned 'charts' that can then be used by operators to express, in a declarative manner, a deployment of that application to the Kubernetes platform. These charts can mask an underlying application that is not declaratively configured very nicely in the hands of a skilled chart author. These charts are the source manifest for a declarative tool though, As such, individual helm charts are not going to be considered for this list. Rather, helm itself would be on this list as an application.
